# MedInfo
Developed an AI-based system to identify medicines from images and automatically extract the medicine name and expiry date using OCR and machine learning techniques. 
The system applies image preprocessing and object detection methods to handle variations in lighting, orientation, and packaging design, ensuring accurate recognition in real-world conditions. 
It also integrates information validation and provides bilingual output (English and Kannada) to enhance usability and accessibility for regional users. 
verall, the project focuses on improving healthcare safety by reducing manual errors in medicine verification and promoting safer medication practices.
